<p>ContentChild works just like a ViewChild</p>
<strong>Only difference is ContentChild works on the Projected content. i.e. It can make a QueryList of components fetched through the 'ng-content' tag</strong>
<p>Again, note that content children will not be set until the ngAfterContentInit component
        lifecycle hook.</p>
